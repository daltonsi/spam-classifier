# SPAM CLASSIFIER

## INTRO
The main purpose of this project is to get additional hands-on experience to supplement my graduate coursework and my career as a Data Scientist/Data Analyst at Apple.

Spam Classification is a classic machine learning task offering a domain to hone fundamental skills in: 

- Python Object Oriented Programming
- Text Processing and basic NLP (e.g. Bag of Words)
- Data Preperation and Storage
- Logisitic Regression Classification and Scorring
- Python NLP and ML Libraries (sklearn, nltk)
- Model Evaluation

The exercise was inspired by a prompt in the Oreily Book on Hands-on Machine Learning: https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/
